  - Animated wave before footer (Hawaiian/ocean theme)
  - Hover effects on logo, nav, donate button, player cards
  - Responsive design for mobile

### Mission Statement
> "Building character through baseball—one player, one game, one moment at a time."

## Design Decisions
1. **Multi-page structure** - Home, Roster, About tabs to keep home page focused
2. **Cooperstown on home page** - directly tied to donation CTA, reduces friction
3. **Roster labeled "2026 Season"** - indicates it's current, not static (important for 501(c)(3) compliance)
4. **501(c)(3) language** - proper tax-deductibility disclaimers included
5. **No baseball stitching** - removed per user preference
6. **Wave animation** - subtle Hawaiian flair without being over the top

## Deployment
- **Domain:** sluggersbaseballhawaii.org (purchased via GoDaddy)
- **Hosting:** TBD - recommend GitHub Pages or Netlify (both free)
- **Status:** Need to set up hosting and point domain

## Notes
- Team photo is from Myrtle Beach Nationals 2025 tournament (South Carolina)
- They're going to Cooperstown (not "earned" their way - just registered to attend)
- Bylaws purpose: "enable and support youth baseball, promote good sportsmanship, educate youth participants and conduct other educational activities"
